There are other things that I haven’t listed but I didn’t want the list to be too crazy and many of these aren’t necessary but they are nice to know about if you ever want them.



 Use LateX and BibTex for writing and referencing your thesis. Avoid Office type applications and learn to use LaTeX. It's the standard article format for research level papers.

I'm writing my master's thesis this year, and wrote my undergrad thesis last year, in LaTeX. All of my research papers are also done in LaTeX.

A good package for Ubuntu that I use for writing LaTeX articles; texmaker

Install with

 sudo apt-get install texmaker

Also do

sudo apt-get install texlive-full
