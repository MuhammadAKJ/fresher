Contributing
================================================================================

If you want to contribute to [fresher](https://github.com/MuhamadAKJ/fresher), please follow these simple rules:

1. Learn how to fork a repo here:

    ![fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui)

2. Clone the repository from your account with:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:your_github_username/fresher.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch with:

    ```
    git checkout -b "fresher-1-fix"
    ```
    You can name it however you want.

4. Make your changes

5. Don't forget to add yourself in `contributors.md`.

6. Commit and push your changes, then make a pull request from Github.

    git commit --signoff  
    git push 
    
7. Awaiting review, if accepted, merged!



**IMPORTANT**

Please, don't forget to update your fork. While you made your changes, the content of the `main` branch can change because other pull requests were merged and it can create conflicts. This is why you have to rebase on `main` every time before pushing your changes and check that your branch doesn't have any conflicts with `main`.

Thank you.
